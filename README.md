# Light Weight Bottle Neck Attention Unet
TF implementation of the architecture described in [A lightweight deep learning model for automatic segmentation and analysis of ophthalmic images](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12486-w) by Sharma et al.

This is an independent implementation unrelated to the autors of the paper. I have used it for segmenting fibers in my own [project](https://wandb.ai/warm-kanelbullar/diameterY/reports/Measuring-the-diameter-of-nanofibers--VmlldzoyMjY2NTg4?accessToken=wvuavha9la5hd0vtt3h6h41fqgb9cdvywrmwwox7os2stkdrbh5vf23dzqq38cf5). Please leave a :star: in this repo if this code is useful to you :smile:.
